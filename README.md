## 🚀 Overview
This project is a Vite-powered React TypeScript application focused on YouTube video content. It leverages Supabase for data management and includes modern UI components built with Tailwind CSS. It serves as a robust starter for similar web applications.

<!-- Add Live Demo Link Here -->
## 🌐 Live Demo
*A live demo of this project can be found here: [Link to Live Demo](#) (Coming Soon!)*

## ⚡ Quickstart
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
   cd <project_directory>   # Replace <project_directory> with the folder name
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying `.env.example` and add your Supabase and YouTube API keys:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
   VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your_youtube_api_key>
   ```
4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
This project is built with a modern tech stack:
- **Frontend Framework:** React (v18.x) with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite - For fast development and optimized builds.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Icons:** Lucide React - A comprehensive and customizable SVG icon library.
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** Supabase - For database storage, authentication, and other backend functionalities.
- **API Integration:** YouTube Data API - For fetching video content.
- **Linting:** ESLint - For code quality and consistency.
- **Package Manager:** npm

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ Fast development experience and optimized production builds via Vite.
- ⚛️ Robust and type-safe component architecture with React and TypeScript.
- 💨 Modern and responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS.
- 📺 Seamless integration with the YouTube API for dynamic video content.
- 🛠️ Easy data management and authentication powered by Supabase.

## 🚀 Deployment
Here are some general guidelines for deploying a Vite + React application:

1.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will create a `dist` folder in your project root with the optimized static assets.

2.  **Deployment Platforms:**
    You can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static site hosting provider. Popular choices include:
    - **Netlify:** Offers seamless deployment from Git, continuous deployment, and a generous free tier.
    - **Vercel:** Known for its excellent Next.js support, but also great for Vite apps. Provides similar features to Netlify.
    - **GitHub Pages:** Free hosting for public repositories.
    - **AWS S3 & CloudFront:** For more scalable and configurable deployments.
    - **Firebase Hosting:** Easy to use and integrates well with other Firebase services.

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Ensure your production environment variables (like `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`) are correctly configured on your hosting platform. **Do not commit your production `.env` file to Git.**
